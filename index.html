<center><pre><h3><mark style="background-color:grey">When vacations meet the summer season, it is the best time for children to make merry.
As they are no longer worried about parents making a fuss about not studying, they engage in different games throughout the day. But sometimes, 
the hot summers prevent them from playing outdoors. So, this essay on indoor games will be helpful for parents and children to know the different 
types of games to be played without stepping out of the comfort of their homes.</mark>
<BR>
<b>Suppose it is raining outside, or we cannot see anything due to the bright light of the Sun, and we are bored sitting at home. Playing indoor games is the best 
option that we have. This is the greatest advantage of indoor games, as they can be played anytime and anywhere. Just like outdoor games, indoor games also provide
entertainment and relaxation for children. Besides, they will improve children’s hand-eye coordination, critical thinking and cognitive abilities. They will also be 
able to know the value of sportsmanship and discipline while playing indoor games.</b>

<em><h1 style = "color:salmon"> Types Of Games</h1> <br></em>

<pre><h3>In this essay on indoor games, we will first see the different types of indoor games that are played by both elders and children. Board games are the most 
common type of indoor games where two or more players gather around a board to play. Young children find favour with Snake and Ladder or Ludo; it is fun to watch their
reaction when the snake bites their counter or they end up last in the game of Ludo. For grown-up children, we can buy them board games based on their interests –
Scrabble for language enthusiasts, Chess for intuitive minds, and Monopoly for business maniacs.
